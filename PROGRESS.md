# Progress Log

## Summary (latest: 2026-11-10, project setup)
The project is set up and ready for data work:
- Git repo on `main`, pushed to https://github.com/theodancey/flood-risk-explorer (`origin`).
- Folder structure from CLAUDE.md created. `data/` and `.venv/` are ignored by Git.
- Virtual environment `.venv` uses **Python 3.13.17**. Python 3.15 didn't work (details below).
- All 14 libraries are installed and pinned in `requirements.txt`. `src/check_setup.py` passes (14/14 import OK).
- README.md, PROGRESS.md, and LEARNING_NOTES.md are in place.

**What you need to do:** nothing required. Two optional items are under "Questions for Theo".

## Questions for Theo
1. *(Optional)* To pick this project's Python from a list inside Jupyter (outside VS Code), run once:
   `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ipykernel install --user --name flood-risk-explorer`
   I skipped this because it writes to `%APPDATA%\jupyter`, which is outside the project folder. VS Code finds `.venv` without it.
2. *(FYI)* You turned off Windows Smart App Control because it was blocking SciPy's `.pyd` files. I re-ran the check afterwards and everything imports, including a direct SciPy test. Smart App Control can't be turned back on without resetting Windows, so you may want to read up on what that means for your security. That's your call; I didn't change any system settings.

## Decisions
- **Python 3.13 instead of 3.15.** On 3.15, `pip install` failed: `pyyaml` (needed by the Jupyter packages) has no prebuilt wheel for 3.15 yet. pip tried to compile it and stopped with "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required." As instructed, I ran `py install 3.13` (installed 3.13.17) and rebuilt `.venv`. Everything installed from prebuilt wheels. I didn't use the Astral CPython 3.14 that's also on the machine, because you named 3.13.
- **Two requirements files.** `requirements.txt` lists the 14 libraries we chose, with pinned versions (easy to read). `requirements-lock.txt` is the full `pip freeze`, including dependencies, for exact reproducibility. Note: pip chose a pre-release of `wrapt` (2.6.0.dev1), which is a dependency of a dependency. It works fine; worth watching if anything odd shows up later.
- **`check_setup.py` recreates `data/raw` and `data/processed`.** `data/` isn't in Git, so a fresh clone won't have those folders.
- **Jupyter version shown is `jupyter-core`'s.** The `jupyter` bundle has no version of its own.

## Log
### 2026-11-10: Project setup
1. `git init -b main`, `.gitignore`, and the folder structure with `.gitkeep` files. Committed.
2. Tried a Python 3.15 venv: failed on `pyyaml`. Installed Python 3.13 and rebuilt the venv. All 14 packages installed.
3. Wrote `requirements.txt`, `requirements-lock.txt`, and `src/check_setup.py`. Ran it: 14/14 OK. Committed.
4. Added README.md and LEARNING_NOTES.md. Committed. Added remote `origin` and pushed to `main` (succeeded using your saved GitHub login).
5. Re-ran `check_setup.py` after you disabled Smart App Control: still 14/14 OK, and SciPy works.
6. Added this PROGRESS.md. Committed and pushed.
